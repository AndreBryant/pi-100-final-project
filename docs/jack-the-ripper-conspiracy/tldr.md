He was known for murders of at least five women in London, particularly near the Whitechapel district, between August and November 1888. It intrigued some people (mostly Filipinos) because Jose Rizal was also in London during those times. Moreover, people speculated that the unidentified killer was Jose Rizal for a number of coincidences.
