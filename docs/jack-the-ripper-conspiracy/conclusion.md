# Conclusion

The conspiracy theory linking Jose Rizal and Jack the Ripper is based on coincidental timelines and some surface-level similarities, such as shared initials and Rizal's medical knowledge. Moreover, these connections and stories lack historical and direct evidence.

Rizal was historically documented to be engaged in scholarly and reformist activities during his stay in London, specifically doing his research in the British Museum Library. His character contrasts greatly to the violent profile of Jack the Ripper. Jose Rizal was documented as a peaceful advocate for reforms in the Philippines while Jack the Ripper was documented to be a gruesome serial killer. Therefore, this conspiracy is not supported by credible evidence and still remains to all just be speculations at best.
