# Who was Jack the Ripper?

Jack the ripper was a serial killer whose identity, until today, still have not been known. He was known for murders of at least five women in London, particularly near the Whitechapel district, between August and November 1888.

Multiple cases of murders have been reported between 1888 and 1892 that have been pointed to Jack the Ripper. However, only five of those, the _canonical five_, were linked by the police to the same culprit.

## "Dear Boss" Letter

The "Dear Boss" letter is one of the key evidences associated to Jack the Ripper. It was sent to the Central News Agency in London on September 27, 1888. The letter overall was evidently just to mock the investigations regarding the serial killings and to give hints to future murders. However, this letter is regarded as the first piece of evidence linking to the identity of a killer known as Jack the Ripper.
