# Debunking the Evidences

While some of the evidences provided previously may be believable, they are just merely coincidental and not indicative of any actual connection.

## Lack of Direct Evidence

Historically, there is no documented evidence that suggests Jose Rizal was considered as a suspect in the Jack the Ripper case.

While conspiracy theorists may provide connections based on coincidences such as timelines and shared initials, it is essential to note that no credible sources or investigations have linked Rizal to the infamous murders in London.

During Jose Rizal's stay in London, he was primarily focused on academic activities and political activism, specifically to reform the system in the Philippines. There are also no documented record of him being in London's Whitechapel district during the time of the murders or aligning him to engage in activites of Jack the Ripper.

Moreover, Rizal's use of a nickname that matches his initials was implausible. It's least likely that a criminal would willingly provide clues to their indentity. Thus, this strongly suggests that the sharing of the same initials was purely coincidental.

## Difference in their Characteristics and Personality Profiles
