# Debunking the Evidences

While some of the evidences provided previously may be believable, they are just merely coincidental and not indicative of any actual connection.

## Lack of Direct Evidence

Historically, there is no documented evidence that suggests Jose Rizal was considered as a suspect in the Jack the Ripper case.

::: warning

While conspiracy theorists may provide connections based on coincidences such as timelines and shared initials, it is essential to note that no credible sources or investigations have linked Rizal to the infamous murders in London.

:::

During Jose Rizal's stay in London, he was primarily focused on scholarly activities and political activism, specifically advocating to reform the system in the Philippines. There are also no documented record of him being in London's Whitechapel district during the time of the murders or aligning him to engage in activites of Jack the Ripper.

Moreover, Rizal's use of a nickname that matches his initials was kind of stupid. It's least likely that a criminal would willingly provide clues to their indentity. Thus, this strongly suggests that the sharing of the same initials was purely coincidental.

## Difference in their Characteristics and Personality Profiles

A critical aspect to consider when evaluating the conspiracy is to see the difference in their known characteristics and behaviors. Given the vast difference below between Rizal's known characteristics as a peaceful individual and the heinous actions attributed to Jack the Ripper, it is least likely that Rizal could have been involved in the Whitechapel murders.

### Jose Rizal

Throughout history, Rizal has been named as the national hero of the Philippines for his contributions and advocacy for social reforms while still being **non-violent**. He was known as an educated individual, a doctor, and an author that advocated Filipino identity and rights. Rizal's character adn actions during his lifetime were described by his dedication to peacful activism and wanting to pursue justice through intellectual discussions.

### Jack the Ripper

On the other hand, Jack the Ripper was infamous for his violent and brutal murders of women in the Whitechapel disctrict of London. The murders involved mutilating his victims in a sadistic manner.

## Historical Documentation

Rizal was registered as a reader at the british museum on August 16, 1888. He was there to expand his knowledge and conduct research, particularly on Philippine History, demonstrating his focus on intellectual and reformist ideas rather than committing criminal activities.

::: tip Note

This evidence supports Rizal's documented commitment to his academic works and to his advocacy for reforms in the Philippines, which contrasts the profile of Jack the Ripper.
