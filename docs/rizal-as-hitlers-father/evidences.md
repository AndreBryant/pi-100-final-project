## Timeline and Locations

Hitler was born in the year 1889 and his conception would overlap with Rizal's time in Austria in 1888. Conspiracy theorists also pointed out that Rizal stayed in Austria for a while during his journey across Europe.

## Rizal's Romantic Affairs

Another evidence is based on Rizal's known romanitc relationships with several women he met on his travels. They suggest that Hitler's mother, Klara Pölzl, is one of them which conspiracy theorists pointed out the similarity of Hitler's mother to Maria Clara, a main character in his first novel.

The affair of Rizal with Pölzl story started with his lost diamond pin stick which was found by a chambermaid. The rumors suggest that the pin was given to Pölzl by Rizal after their affair. The affair was due to the heartbreak experience the two had at that time and found comfort with each other after Rizal stayed at a lodge managed by Pölzl (Rizal not being to communicate with Leonor Rivera, his childhood sweetheart, and Pölzl being told to stay away from his husband as she was his third wife by the second wife).
