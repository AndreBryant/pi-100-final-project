# How Creative Filipinos Can Really Get

Upon reflecting on the conspiracy theory that suggests Rizal is the biological father of Hitler, it truly shows how Filipinos can get creative and go to great lengths to expound on mere coincidences and stretch them to an extent that they can call "truth." Even though the provided evidence can be easily debunked after a closer inspection and brief research, it is still considered a myth by some people.

Some would say that this is just people trying to make entertainment or a joke based solely on their similar appearance and adding more "details" to make it believable. However, I can see that Rizal's life still holds some mystery, which has given birth to conspiracy theories about his life.
